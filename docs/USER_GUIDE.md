```

## üìù Basic Usage

### Saving Your First Context

During any conversation with Claude, simply say:
- "Save this conversation"
- "Create a context checkpoint"
- "Capture this discussion"

Claude will respond with:
```
‚úÖ Context saved successfully!

Session ID: Claude-20250802143000

Use this ID to resume this conversation later.
```

### What Gets Saved?

- **Summary**: AI-generated overview of the discussion
- **Key Decisions**: Important choices and conclusions
- **Next Actions**: Identified tasks and follow-ups
- **Code Snippets**: Any code discussed (if applicable)
- **Project Association**: Links to your project
- **Tags**: Automatic categorization

### Resuming a Conversation

To continue a previous conversation:

1. Start a new chat in Claude Desktop
2. Paste the Session ID:
   ```
   Claude-20250802143000
   ```
3. Claude loads all previous context
4. Continue where you left off!

## üèóÔ∏è Working with Projects

### Automatic Project Creation

When you save context, Claude will:
1. Check if you mentioned a project name
2. Find existing project or create new one
3. Link the conversation automatically

### Manual Project Assignment

You can explicitly specify a project:
```
Save this to the "Mobile App Development" project
```

### Viewing Projects in Notion

Your Notion workspace contains:
- **Projects Database**: All your projects with status
- **Chat Summaries**: All conversations organized by project

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/notion-projects-view.png" alt="Notion Projects View" width="600">
  <p><i>Projects database showing active development work</i></p>
</div>

```

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Regular Context Saves
- Save context at natural breakpoints
- Before switching topics or projects
- After making important decisions
- When identifying action items

### 2. Meaningful Summaries
- Let Claude auto-generate summaries
- Add specific details if needed
- Include "why" not just "what"

### 3. Project Organization
- One project per major initiative
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Archive completed projects

### 4. Tag Strategy
- Technical tags: #frontend #backend #database
- Status tags: #blocked #needs-review #urgent
- Type tags: #bug-fix #feature #refactor

### 5. Session Management
- Save Session IDs in your project docs
- Share IDs with team members
- Create "checkpoint" saves before major changes

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Context Not Saving?

1. Check Claude Desktop is running
2. Verify Notion API key in settings
3. Run health check: `npm run health-check`

### Can't Resume Session?

- Verify Session ID format: `Claude-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`
- Check Notion connection
- Ensure project still exists

### Notion Sync Issues

```bash
# Test Notion connection
npm run test-notion

# Reset configuration
npm run reset-config
```

### Performance Problems

- Check Notion API limits (3 req/sec)
- Verify network connection
- Clear local cache if needed
