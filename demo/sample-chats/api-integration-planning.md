# Chat Summary: API Integration Planning
**Session ID:** Claude-20250715093000  
**Date:** July 15, 2025  
**Project:** E-Commerce Platform Redesign

## Summary
Discussed the architecture for integrating multiple payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, Square) into the e-commerce platform. Established a unified payment interface pattern and error handling strategy.

## Key Decisions
- Use adapter pattern for payment provider integration
- Implement circuit breaker for failed payment attempts
- Store payment tokens, never raw card data
- Add webhook endpoints for async payment notifications

## Code Snippets
```javascript
// Payment adapter interface
interface PaymentAdapter {
  processPayment(amount: number, token: string): Promise<PaymentResult>;
  refund(transactionId: string): Promise<RefundResult>;
  getTransactionStatus(id: string): Promise<TransactionStatus>;
}
```

## Next Actions
- [ ] Create base PaymentAdapter class
- [ ] Implement StripeAdapter
- [ ] Set up webhook infrastructure
- [ ] Design error recovery flows
